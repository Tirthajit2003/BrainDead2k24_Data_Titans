### Overview
This repository contains the solution for Problem Statement 1 of the BrainDead 2K24 competition, focusing on analyzing rice production data in India and predicting rice production in Indian states/union territories. The competition aimed to provide insights into state-wise rice production trends and develop predictive models for future production estimates.

### Contents
- **Data Analysis Report**: A concise report detailing the analysis methodology, findings, and predictive model for rice production.
- **Code**: Python code for data analysis and predictive modeling, implemented using Jupyter Notebook.
- **Dataset**: The dataset provided by the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare, Government of India, containing state-wise rice production data from 2004-2005 to 2022-2023.
- **README.md**: Instructions for running the code and reproducing the analysis.

### How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Colab Notebook file (`braindead_rice_production.ipynb`) and follow the instructions to run the code.
3. Refer to the Data Analysis Report for insights and methodology details.
4. Use the provided predictive model to estimate rice production for the next 5 years in Indian states/union territories.
